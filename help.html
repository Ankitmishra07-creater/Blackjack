                    Blackjack (formerly Black Jack and Vingt-Un) is a casino banking game. 
                    It is the most widely played casino banking game in the world. 
                    It uses decks of 52 cards and descends from a global family of casino banking games known as Twenty-One. 
                    Blackjack's immediate precursor was the English version of twenty-one called Vingt-Un, a game of unknown (but likely Spanish) provenance. 
                    The first written reference is found in a book by the Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes.
